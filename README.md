# Phase1
Energy calculation was performed using "Dynamical_Matrix_AR_Kong.py," and the waves were created using one of the WaveCreator files. The other two filed, "Energy_Check.py" and "K_Chkeck.py," are for the post-processing of the data created by wave-packet simulations.

The Publication related to this repository is the following,
